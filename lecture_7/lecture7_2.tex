CLOUD FORENSICS 
    One of the problems with cloud is that cloud means a lot of things to a lot of different people 
    What are we referring to as cloud forensics?
        We distinguish mostly Infrastructure as a service, PlatformaaS, SaaS

    Distinction between public cloud (above), private cloud: a company internally reorganized their infrastructure as something based on a private cloud.
    but we are interested in acquiring data from a public cloud, because we cannot access directly the hardware 

    Acquisition issues 
        whenever we have a public cloud system, we access data without accessing hardware 
        In infrastructure as a service, most access, vm on aws. 
        Our acquisition methods will never be dumping a drive but, copying a virtual machine.
        Difference with the traditional forensics process.
        The acquisition of the vms running in a cloud provider, it's not a problem. cie uno papero 

        We do not acquire from bare metal but we have a way to acquire virtual machines remotely 
        
        In IaaS we can dump the virtual machine, we will access to everything except for ()
        
        In SaaS we have nothing, if we have log is ok, but ?

        Depending on the type of infrastructure we may have different kinds of access to data.

        Logs of third parties have higher credibility than your logs because of the fact that you may have manipulated them

        In cloud proving time of events is easier, because of the third parties 

Real problem is that data maybe sometimes do not exists 
    page of instagram video is not stored, it is composed at the moment that you see 
    with the data at that moment 

    Data we acquire is the result of a transaction, of a running application   
    Hard to understand for judges, lawyers, court people.

Acquisition issues 
    even in simple cases there is a series of things to make it hard 
    Pages are dynamic content, before they were static and you could fetch them from the server 
    In dynamic content what we see is something unreproducible in court 
    simple print out is not sufficient.
    If the page is composed by elements imported by different external services, how much can we acquire of them?


    visualization is different from data 
    
    attribution is important 
        suppose to have a case with a certain infrastructrue, and one of the question is where physically is located the server that was deploying the structure 
        suppose to have ip address, website, how to determine where physically the datacenter is located, it's not an easy question 
        there are cases where from this question depends taxation
