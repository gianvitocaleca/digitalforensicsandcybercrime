Expert-based knowledge
    Based on the domain knowledge of the fraud analyst: gathering and processing the right information in the right manner.
    
    Detailed and manual investigation of suspicious cases, which may indicate a new fraud mechanism
        -understand and address the new mechanism 
    Comprehension of the fraud mechanism allows extending the fraud detection and prevention mechanism. Every time a new transaction is flagged suspicious, is going to be investigated, if it's labeled as fraud, the specific case will be added to the fraud detection mechanism.


Fraud investigation and management
    When fraudulent activites have been detected and confirmed, two types of measures are typically taken:
        Corrective 
        Preventive 

    Corrective Measures 
        Aim to resolve the fraud and correct the consequences. Go past your log to also check if in the past similar fraud cases happened (Retrospective Screening)
        The sooner corrective measures are taken and fraud is detected, the more effective such measures are and the more losses can be avoided

Red flags of frauds
        Scheme, behaviours, which seems to be out of place. Something you want to detect because it belongs to a fraud scheme.
        Them are translated in expert rules and included in a rule engine.
    
Rule-based Engine Disadvantages 
        Everytime you have to detect case, and manually write the rule for that specific case
        The more complex is the mechanism, the more complex is the rule translation 
        Easy to bypass rules (example, go over a treshold of a little bit)
        Rules based on past history, new fraud patterns are not automatically signaled.

        You need to continously monitor, improve and updtate rule based engine to remain effective.

Fraud becomes easier to detect the more time has passed
        A fraud mechanism is first successifully used: it will increase in the usage, and in the number of this particular type of Fraud
        The more a scheme is used, the more is evident, easier is to detect, also past-happened cases are discovered
        So big data can be explored and exploited for fraud detection at a lower cost = data-driven fraud detection

Expert-based Systems
    relies on human expert input, evaluation and monitoring 
    Starting point and complementary tool to develop an effective fraud-detection and prevention system

    Automated data driven fraud detection systems 
        Requires less human involvement 
        Could lead to a more efficient and effective system 
        Expert knowledge remains crucial to build effective systems 

Data-driven fraud detection 
    1 - Precision
    2 - Operational Efficiency 
    3 - Cost efficiency 
    4 - Growing amount of interest 

    1 - Precision 
        Organizations have a limited investigation capacity. These systems are able to increase the detection power wrt the classic approaches.
        Process massive volumes of information to uncover frauds that are not apparent to the human eye 
        Goals:
            Make optimal use of the limited investigation capacity 
            Maximize the fraction of fraudulent cases among the inspected ones (more frauds detected)
    
    2 - Operational and Cost Efficiency
        Imagine you want to build a system to detect cc transaction frauds vs bonifici (bank transfer)

        cc detection you want to know immediately they stole your card 
        bank transfer needs 2 days to be executed, you can wait it .

        Choose the correct detection system depending on the context

Fraud-Detection techniques
    Frauds are hard to detect 
        and they remain hard and complex to detect even if fraud-detection approaches have evolved and gained significant power over the past years

Fraud detection is challenging
    Number: average behavior, whatever deviates from the norm is stange and so fraudulent 

Fraud detection techniques
    Need for new techniques that are able to detect and
    address stealthy patterns

    Unsupervised Learning: used every single time you don't have lables 
    Supervised Learning: 

Unsupervised:
    no label, learn the norm from historical observation
    Detecting anomalies = find behavior that deviates from normal one.
    Allow detecting novel fraud pattern 
    Complementary tool to improve its expert rule-based fraud-detection system.

    Example: telecommunications fraud 

Disadvantages 
    Mimic the normal behavior by slightly changing the features to make the thing less findable by the thing 
    camouflage-like fraud strategies 

Supervised learning techniques 
    bla bla spiega 
    used to 
    predict frauds
    detect frauds 
    estimate the amount of fraud 

Disadvantages 
    We need to have a labeled dataset --> difficult because it's not a good advertisement for the bank to expose itself 
    Low detection power against different and new fraud types 

Complementarity of supervised and unsupervised methods 
    Use both in developing a powerful fraud-detection and prevention system 
    They focus on different aspects of fraud.

    you'll get a list of transactions ranked by their anomaly scoring 

    unsupervised learning part is used to optimize the detection capacity.
    supervised + user is used to classify transactions 

Graph/Network analysis 
    Possible to combine the before-tokd sup+unsup with this.
    graphs of interactions between different financial institutions 

Frauds are a dynamic phenomenon (slide 116 sua 13:40 slide 80 nostra)
Good detection power (continua)
    reduce as much as possible false positive, because the code means it was written by someone paid for "nothing", and clients may feel annoyed and change bank 
    low false alarm rate

Skewness of the data = only a limited number of cases are frauds

Operational Efficiency 
    Limited amount of time to reach a decision and let a transaction pass or not 
        impacts design of operations IT systems 
        analytical model?

    Must be able to deal with the massive volumes of data.
